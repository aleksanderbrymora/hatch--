An arduino project for controlling an automated cellar.

Controlls:

- Linear actuator for opening the hatch
- LEDs for lighting the cellar
- OLED Screen for displaying information

Reads:

- Temperature and humidity
- User interaction through various buttons

TODO:

- Fan control based on the temperature/humidity
- Heater control based on the temperature
- Dehumidifier control based on the humidity readout
- Custom PCB using Atmel Atmega328P or other programmable microcontroller to clean up the control panel. (PCB design stage)
